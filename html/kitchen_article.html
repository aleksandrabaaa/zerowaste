                <h3>HOW TO REDUCE FOOD WASTE </h3>
                <p>We throw away 7.2 million tons of food every year, and more than half of it’s perfectly edible. Meanwhile, 1 in 7 people across the world don't have enough to eat. Everyday supermarkets throw away lots of food which expiration dates ended. Meanwhile, that food is still edible. Food industry is one of the most dangerous factory for our environment and economy. But I guess you’re going to ask: what can we do?</p>

            <section class="howtoreduce_container" style="margin-top: 150px;">
                <p>Not only the supermarkets trash a lot of food, but also we do. What would you do with ripe bananas, stale bread or parched herbs?<br>Would you throw them out or do your best to save them somehow?</p>
                <p>I would like to show you simple ways how to reduce your food waste and improve you cooking skills in environmental-friendly, zero-waste cooking. Real food tastes better, costs less, and usually doesn't take any longer to make. Discover what you've been missing by cooking virtually everything your eat from scratch.</p><br>
                <h3>Veggie stock from veggie scraps</h3><br>
                <p>What to save:<br>
                    &#9679; top, bottom and skins from:<br>
                    &#9679; onions<br>
                    &#9679; celery<br>
                    &#9679; carrots<br>
                    &#9679; garlic<br>
                    &#9679; mushrooms<br>
                    &#9679; potatoes<br>
                    &#9679; water</p><br>
                <h5>How to make a veggie stock of it?</h5>
                <p>Put everything to a large pot, pour water as much as to cover the scraps. Bring it to boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain the stock. You can keep it in the fridge or freeze for further recipes. You can use it for soups or sauces.<br>
                    Bon appetite!</p><br>
                <p>Once you start looking, there are a thousand little ways we can make environmentally friendly choices in the kitchen. Regrowing vegetable scraps is just one of them. Not only is this a fun science experiment, but also cheap and easy. Green onion, cabbage, onion and green garlic are all delicious in a stir-fry or fried rice. Baby beet greens, celery shoots and romaine lettuce is harvested for salads, and carrot tops can be made into pesto.<br>
                    Let’s look how to make it!</p><br>
                <p>After using the main part of the vegetable leave the top of it. You can do this with:<br>
                    &#9679; carrot<br>
                    &#9679; beet<br>
                    &#9679; turnip<br>
                    &#9679; radishe<br><br>
                    Also you can leave the ends of:<br>
                    &#9679; romaine lettuce<br>
                    &#9679; celery<br>
                    &#9679; bok choi<br>
                    &#9679; green onion<br>
                    &#9679; garlic<br>
                    &#9679; leek<br>
                    &#9679; fennel
                    <p /><br>
                    <h5>How to do this?</h5>
                    <p>Cut about 3 centimeters of top or end and place in the water but don’t submerge. Up to 3 days you’ll see little sprouts. That’s a good sign.<br>
                        Happy growing!</p><br>
                    <h3>Dolce&amp;Banana</h3><br>
                    <p>I guess everyone has ever experienced that: you went to the shop, buy a bunch of beautiful, fresh, golden bunch of bananas and after fee days they became brown. Then they look neither fancy nor tasty. What would you do? Wait! I’ll tell you: the most delicious, moist and sweet banana bread.<br>
                        So march to the kitchen to make it.</p><br>
                    <p>Prepare:<br>

                        &#9679; spoon or something to mix<br>
                        &#9679; baking tray<br>
                        &#9679; baking paper<br><br>

                        &#9679; 3-4 ripe bananas<br>
